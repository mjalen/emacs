# Jalen's Emacs Configuration

A really simple and bare bones configuration for Emacs. This configuration has the following goals:

- Use builtin Emacs functionalities as much as possible (where appropriate).
- Use the builtin package manager.
- Keep a *small* configuration that is maintainable by an individual. I used to have a huge `.org` configuration that became increasingly more difficult to maintain and would always break on different machines.
- Replace the need for a terminal emulator with `magit`, `async-shell-command`, and `project-compile`.
- Have fun and discover new ways to simplify and make a more comfy programming experience.
